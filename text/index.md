## TIDE Academy Student-Led Website

<!-- Written by Mikaela Scheel -->

The TIDE student's website is an unofficial school website made and maintained
by the web development club. The purpose is to make a website that's more
specifically tailored to the needs of students instead of general information
about the school. The web development club meets on tuesday at lunch in room
105, also known as Mr. Cornejo's and Mr. Stagg's room.

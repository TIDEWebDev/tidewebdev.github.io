## TIDE Electives

### Multimedia Design

Multimedia, taught by Mr. Klackle, is similar to TIDE's GID pathway, but can be
taken as early as freshman year without having to go through all 3 years of GID.

In multimedia, students are taught industry-standard digital editing tools such
as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. Tools are
provided to students for free, along with laptops and a Mac computer lab.

Teaching is done through project-based assignments, in which students have to
use these tools to edit photos, put together "trailers" and videos, and make
collages.

These tools are also used for TIDE's Ripple Report.

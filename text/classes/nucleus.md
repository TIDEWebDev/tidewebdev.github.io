## About Nucleus

Nucleus is TIDE's advisory class. Held on every day but Tuesday, students are
given support with classes they may be struggling with.

### FlexTime

On Wednesdays and Thursdays, students can sign up for
["Flex,"](https://teachmore.org/tideacademy/students/) a way to let students
meet with teachers with designated school time, meaning students aren't required
to spend their lunch breaks catching up on late work.

During Flex, students can sign up to spend the class period in any teacher's
classroom to catch up on late work, e.g. an unfinished science lab, work on
homework, or anything else that's easier with teacher support.

### Roadtrip Nation

Beginning in 10th grade, students are helped plan out their future career goals
through [Roadtrip Nation](https://roadtripnation.com/). Students are given
support to find their interests, along with projects encouraging meeting with
someone in a profession the student is interested in.

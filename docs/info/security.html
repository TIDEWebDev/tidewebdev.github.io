    <h2>Making Sure Your Account is Secure - How To Change Your Password</h2>
<p>By default, student E-mail accounts are given a password that consists of your
initials and birthday. This is really easy to guess and makes it really easy for
other students to log into your account, which you shouldn't do, but it <em>has</em>
happened.</p>
<p>It's important to change your password to something more secure, which is
something many students didn't do.</p>
<p>This can be done by navigating to your Google account (for your school email)
and finding the password section. Navigating to change password should send you
to <a href="https://pwm.seq.org/pwm/private/Login">this page</a>. (You can also click this
link directly, although if anything changes in the future going through Google
should be more reliable.)</p>
<p>You should see a page that looks something like this:
<img alt="Password Self Service login page" src="/img/pwm.png" /></p>
<p>Log in using your school E-mail address, without the "@seq.org" part. (Just your
student ID.) From there, changing your password should be straightforward. Keep
in mind this should also automatically sync with your school laptop
PIN/password. Don't choose something you might forget.</p>

    <h2>Dual-enrollment with Foothill College</h2>
<p>TIDE offers dual-enrollment courses through Foothill College, through which
students can take college-level and college-credit courses while continuing to
attend TIDE.</p>
<p>These classes are either co-taught by a Foothill professor and TIDE teacher,
taught by a college-certified TIDE teacher, or done fully online, taught by a
Foothill professor, with a TIDE teacher offering support in-person.</p>
<p>Many classes offer dual-enrollment by default, allowing students to earn college
credits without needing to put in a significantly larger amount of effort, and
TIDE's counseling team makes signing up for other Foothill courses easy.</p>
